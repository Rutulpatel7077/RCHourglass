# RCHourglass
DIY lap timing system

# What is it?
RC Hourglass is a project to develop a DIY automatic timing system that can be used in RC racing and other sporting events.
The focus of the project is hardware design of the pieces of the system. 
The hardware is compatible with existing lap timing software.The project idea comes from two threads in RCTech.net forums about 
lap timing devices design by Howard Cano.The scope of the project is to simplify the design, document the building process and 
add new features.

# Project status
The project is in beta testing status. Two working prototypes have been tested succesfully.

# How to contribute
Right now the most useful contribute would be feedback in the system performance/build reports/electronic design (for example PCBs).
Also feature requests are wellcome. When stable enoguh, the full source of the project will be released for further development
